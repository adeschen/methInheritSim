\description{
This package does a permutation analysis, based on Monte Carlo sampling,
for testing the hypothesis that the number of conserved differentially
methylated elements (sites, tiles or regions), between
several generations, is associated to an effect inherited from a treatment
and that stochastic effect can be dismissed.
